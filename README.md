# wbc-utils

Utility for [White Box Cartoonization](https://github.com/SystemErrorWang/White-box-Cartoonization) that enables bulk processing of images and videos.

## How 2 use
1) Download and install wbc.
2) Make sure the `test_images` and `cartoonized_images` folders are empty.
3) Put your images and videos in `...\test_code\src`
4) `python wbc-utils.py ...\test_code`. Make sure to use the same python interpreter you would run wbc with.
5) Enjoy.

## Python sucks
Initially I wrote this script in C# but I had to switch to python. I won't touch this language ever again.
